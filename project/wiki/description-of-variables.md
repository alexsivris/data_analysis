In this section, we make reasoning about why we selected following
variables in our <b><i>X matrix</i></b>. First of all, since our purpose is to
investigate what factors and at what level are contributing the average
happiness of a nation, we ask the question, “what will probably affect a
persons happiness if it changes?” when selecting variables for <b><i>X matrix</i></b>.
On the other hand,for <b><i>y vector</i></b> we ask the question, how to measure happiness of
people and since it is not an abstract thing that we can measure
directly, we used a survey ([world happiness report 2016](http://worldhappiness.report)) for making a comparison of happiness level of
countries. In the following table, we have written all variables that we
reasoned to use for X matrix.

  Population
-------
It is a fact that the population and its derivatives are considered as a clear indicator for the development of a country. Since in developed countries people are expected to be happy, these features regarding population may be a sign for the happiness.



                                Rural population (% of total population)                                                     World Bank

  Mortality  
-------------        
In a country where are more suicide cases, you can easily say that people are on average less happy than the others. Also in countries where Life Expectancy is low or experiences less traffic accident, you expect that people are happier.

  Material Life   
---------------      
It goes without saying that people tend to use some materials when they feel unhappy and powerless. From this perspective, we wanted to use these features to make a relation between unhappiness of a country.

  Health Expenditure

Health is one of the main human rights and it must be provided properly for the sake of having a happy nation.

  National Growth
-------------------
By basic reasoning, it is more than normal to think that there is a strong relation between a countrys growth and average happiness of people in that country.

  Income and Poverty 
-------------------
Regardless of the country growth, peoples average income also is considered a strong sign of happiness. Since many thinks that money bring happiness. Besides that, the equality in income share may be a good feature to look at.

                                Adjusted net national income per capita (constant 2005 US\$)                                   World Bank

  Unemployment  
-------------------
Because of the fact that we considered development of a country may be a important variable for happiness of people, we should investigate the unemployment rates in community in order to make a comparison between countries development.

                                Long-term unemployment (% of total unemployment)                                               World Bank

                                Unemployment, youth total (% of total labor force ages 15-24) (national estimate)              World Bank
