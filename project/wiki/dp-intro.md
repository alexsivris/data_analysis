# Data Processing #

## 1 Introduction ##
<br>
In the first section of the data processing part we are going to present the various methods we used to prepare our data for further analysis. Then, we are going to describe the process we used to iteratively discard further variables without losing much of the predictive ability of the fitted response. In the third section we are going to reveal the “truly” important variables for happiness, and their respective weights. For demonstration purposes we are also going to predict the happiness score for a few countries that weren’t in the training set. After the detailed description of the steps we took for processing, we are going to try to interpret the results. We explain the reasons for the existing variables based on theories that have resulted from external research on the subject.
