The project is a report  on life satisfaction level across various
countries and the determination of variables that contributes to maximum
life satisfaction. Life satisfaction  evaluation is based on
people's life as a whole rather than their current feelings,
hence evaluation reveals a populated weighted average score on a scale
running from 0-10 that is tracked over time and compared with other
countries. The variable set taken as a set of well being includes
factors such as education, economic well being, food, culture, etc.
The data for the calculation has been collected for 138 countries with
95  features. But some of the features are discarded becasue of high number of 
`NaN` (Not a Number) values. At final we had 67 variables.
